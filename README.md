![alpine-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/gliderlabs%2Falpine-3.2-green.svg) ![docker-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-1.7.1-green.svg)

Docker in Docker Alpine Linux image with support for latest Docker release.


## Usage

_The same instructions from https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind apply here, just
replace `jpetazzo/dind` with `fgrehm/alpine-dind`._


## Credits

This is based on the alpine image available at https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind/tree/master/alpine
and it also uses the [`wrapdocker` script](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind/blob/master/wrapdocker)
provided by it.

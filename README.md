# docker-alpine-dind

Alpine Linux image with support for latest Docker in Docker (1.7.1 as of this writing)


## Usage

_The same instructions from https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind apply here, just
replace `jpetazzo/dind` with `fgrehm/alpine-dind`._


## Credits

This is based on the alpine image available at https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind
and it also uses the [`wrapdocker` script](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind/blob/master/wrapdocker)
provided by it.
